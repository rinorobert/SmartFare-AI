# Auto Fare Transparency System - SmartFare-AI

## Problem Statement
Travelers in Kollam district often face uncertainty and disputes in last-mile auto and taxi fares due to non-usage of meters and arbitrary pricing. This project aims to build a data-driven system that estimates a fair fare range using Kerala government fare rules, distance, time, and real-world data to improve transparency and trust.
