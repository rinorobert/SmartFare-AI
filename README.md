# Auto Fare Transparency System

This project aims to build an AI-based system that estimates a fair fare range for auto-rickshaw and taxi travel using government fare rules, distance, time, and real-world data.  
The initial implementation focuses on Kollam district, Kerala, with a scalable design for other regions.
